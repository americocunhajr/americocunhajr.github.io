title: "ElectroM: ElectroMechanical Dynamic Code"
logo: "ElectroM.png"
description: "This is a computational tool for simulating the nonlinear dynamics of electromechanical systems. It models interactions between electrical circuits and mechanical structures, making it particularly useful for mechatronic systems, piezoelectric actuators, and energy harvesting devices. The software allows users to study system responses under different excitations and optimize design parameters for improved performance."
