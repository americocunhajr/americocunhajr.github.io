title: "CRFlowLib â€” Chemically Reacting Flow Library"
logo: "CRFlowLib.png"
description: "A computational library for simulating and analyzing chemically reacting flows. It provides capabilities to solve fluid dynamics equations coupled with chemical reaction mechanisms, making it particularly useful for studying combustion phenomena and reactive flows. The library is implemented in C and uses the In Situ Adaptive Tabulation (ISAT) algorithm for thermochemical calculations, offering an efficient and robust framework for numerical experiments in computational chemistry and fluid dynamics."
