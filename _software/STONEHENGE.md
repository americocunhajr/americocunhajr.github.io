title: "STONEHENGE: Suite for Nonlinear Analysis of Energy Harvesting Systems"
logo: "STONEHENGE.png"
description: "This is a comprehensive code suite for analyzing the nonlinear dynamics of vibration-based energy harvesters. It includes implementations in MATLAB and C++, offering numerical simulations, bifurcation analysis, and optimization routines for maximizing energy output. The software is tailored for researchers working on piezoelectric and magnetoelastic energy harvesting devices, providing a robust framework for studying complex multi-stable systems and their efficiency under stochastic and deterministic excitations."
