title: "SpringpotTune: Variable-Order Springpot Model Tuning via Cross-Entropy Method"
logo: "SpringpotTune.png"
description: "This is a MATLAB-based tool designed to optimize the parameters of fractional-order rheological models, specifically the springpot element, used in viscoelastic material modeling. By employing advanced optimization techniques such as the Cross-Entropy method, the software finds the best fractional-order parameters to fit experimental data. This tool is particularly relevant for biomechanics, polymer science, and mechanical engineering, where accurate modeling of viscoelastic materials is crucial."
