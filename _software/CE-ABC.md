title: "CE-ABC: Cross-Entropy Approximate Bayesian Computation"
logo: "CE-ABC.png"
description: "This MATLAB package integrates the Cross-Entropy method with Approximate Bayesian Computation for uncertainty quantification in mechanistic epidemic models defined by ordinary differential equations. It provides a robust framework for parameter inference and statistical optimization in epidemiological models, allowing real-data analysis and disease outbreak forecasting. The code is designed to be accessible for researchers and students interested in computational epidemiology and Bayesian statistics."
