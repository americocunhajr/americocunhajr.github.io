Welcome to my Nonlinear Art Gallery! Nonlinear systems are fascinating objects that give rise to complex and intricate phenomena, often associated with beautiful geometric structures. In this gallery, I have curated a collection of "mathematical pieces of art", some of which are from my own research, and others well-known in the literature. While these works originate from the realm of scientific inquiry, my intention is to showcase their artistic appeal. I invite you to take a moment to browse through the gallery and appreciate the captivating beauty of nonlinear dynamics.
