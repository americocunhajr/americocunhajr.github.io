## 👋 Welcome to My Page!

I am an Associate Professor of Applied Mathematics at [Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ)](https://www.uerj.br){:target="_blank"}. This summer, I will join the team of the [National Laboratory of Scientific Computing (LNCC)](https://www.lncc.br){:target="_blank"}, a research unit of the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation.

My research work lies in the intersection between Applied Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, and Computational Science, revolving around understanding complex systems, from origami metamaterials to epidemic phenomena.

📌 What drives me?

I focus on both quantitative modeling and qualitative analysis of nonlinear systems, seeking to obtain nontrivial insights about their behavior, helping in this way to design better engineering systems, optimize their performance, and develop innovative control strategies.
