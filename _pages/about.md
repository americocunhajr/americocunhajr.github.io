## About Me

I work with **Nonlinear Dynamical Systems**, a branch of mathematics that deals with time-dependent phenomena. The focus of my research is not only on constructing quantitative models for complex systems but also on understanding their inherent nonlinearities. My goal is to obtain **qualitative insights** into a system's **dynamic behavior** and develop strategies for **design, optimization, and control**.

More recently, I became interested in **Artificial Intelligence, Data Science**, and the use of **statistical/machine learning** techniques to extract and understand complex patterns from databases. My research spans a broad range of applications:
- **Energy Harvesting**
- **Vibroacoustic Metamaterials**
- **Origami Geometry**
- **Epidemic Outbreaks**
- **Structural Health Monitoring**
- **Biomedical Engineering**
- **Drilling Systems**
- **Reactive Flows**

## Research Group

In my research group, we specialize in cutting-edge **numerical, analytical, and data-driven techniques** for both deterministic and probabilistic **direct and inverse analyses of nonlinear systems**, as well as for **data analytics**. Our collaboration network includes:
