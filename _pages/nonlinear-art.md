## Nonlinear Patterns in Science and Art

My research in **dynamical systems and nonlinear physics** has inspired artistic visualizations.

### Generative Artworks
- **Chaos Patterns**: Generated using attractors from nonlinear ODEs.
- **Origami Symmetry**: Computational folding simulations with unique geometric properties.
- **Fractal Waveforms**: Visual representations of multi-scale energy interactions.

_Sample images coming soon!_
